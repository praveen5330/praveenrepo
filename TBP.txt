Questions to others
=====================================


performance Issues
=========================
1. Application level	
   This talks about coding standards and design patterns used and number of network calls/remote calls making to complete a request.

2. Server level
	Load balancer-> Verticle sacling or Horizantal scaling
	Verticle sacling : one machine with number of nodes( 1 machine with 4 jobss servers) . draback is if machine is down then applicaiton is down.
	Horizantal scaling : 4 machines with 4 servers

3. Infrastructural level
	machine is in linux or windows or RAM speed, Processer..  like.. 

definitions
=========
Encapsulation : Wrapping data and methods within classes in combination with implementation hiding (through access control) is often called encapsulation. 

Weaving: linking aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object. This can be done at compile time (using the AspectJ compiler, for example), load time, or at runtime. Spring AOP, like other pure Java AOP frameworks, performs weaving at runtime.


Questions :
======================
1. Other usage of Userdefiend Exception(apart from redability, maintaince, dataloss)
2. How to insert same record into two tables at a time
3. delete all duplicate rows from a table
4. Inheritance realtime example
5. Why hash table dosen't allow null values?
6. How to write log stmts only if exception occurs??
7. How do you do the code review?
8. DTO vs Entity beans
